**This was a year of change for me. I graduated as a Civil Engineer, moved to a new apartment with my girlfriend, and chose a path to follow for (at least) a year. This is my personal journey from an engineering student to an indie hacker.**

# January through May

Why almost half a year in a single section? Because I didn't write down what I did 😅 , so we will breeze through what I remember about those months.

In **January**, I spent most of the month studying for my very last final. I took advantage of the studying methods and [spaced repetition knowledge](https://robertinomartinez.com/posts/How-to-remember-anything-forever) that I acquired over the years and **made 1226 Anki flashcards** with the entire subject. Following this method, the final in the first days of February was a pretty easy one.

During every break and time off, I mostly **worried about what to do with my life** after graduation. The most probable options where:

- Pursue an MSc or Ph.D. in a foreign country.
- Work as a Civil Engineer to gain work experience.
- Try my luck as an Indie Hacker (I had a loose concept at the time).
- Work for some ONGs to gain time while figuring out what I wanted to do with my life.

I was so lost that I could change my "most probable" decision twice in a single week.

## The Phantom Menance

Done with the finals, and with my thesis completed, everything was on track to graduate from university in **March**. But then... Covid struck, all universities close down, and my thesis presentation was postponed indefinitely.

As disappointed as I was, Covid opened an opportunity for me. I had most of my responsibilities virtually paused in a situation where I needed deep introspection coupled with research about possible paths in life. So I did what any reasonable person would do:

**I started learning Japanese. 5hs a day.**

And it was intense. I followed the [Mass Immersion Approach (MIA)](https://massimmersionapproach.com/). I was investing between 4 and 5hs every day in a foreign language that I surely won't need instead of focusing on choosing a path or direction (at least for the year). Impeccable reasoning, I know.

Luckily, on the firsts days of **April**, I stopped with the hardcore language learning stuff. Although I learned little Japanese, I learned a lot about how the brain processes language, linguistics, and language acquisition. Super interesting stuff.

_"Good"_, you would say, _"now you will focus on what matters!"_. Well... I'm not sure if I did that. The thing is, **in April and May, I went on a rampage**. I studied art, philosophy, investing, architecture, business, programming, more Japanese (but not as intense as the first time), etc.

I was learning everything that I could about every subject that I stumble upon. It felt freeing. Nothing really stopped me from studying all of this before (and I did, in smaller amounts) but, for some reason, I just started doing it automatically, nonstop.

In retrospect, maybe I was **scared of wasting time**, or I was **looking for something that can hook my interest more than any other thing**. I have the problem (blessing?) that **everything is interesting to me**. Therefore, it is easy for me to pick one thing to do or study, but extremely hard to ignore everything else. I don't think there is something that I would love to do so much that everything else is secondary, nevertheless, I will keep looking for it.

# June

Finally, in June, **I presented my thesis** via Zoom and **completed my undergraduate student career**. It was an exciting topic:

**The analysis and development of an artificial neural network that predicts the reservoir level of the San Roque damn several months in advance.**

It was a stretch for a Civil Engineering thesis, but the professors saw my excitement and approved the project. I must admit that I was... <s>a pain in the ass</s> persistent with that proposal.

Said model is now being used by the government to manage more efficiently the water resource and energy generation of the damn.

</figure>

Since the 16th of June, I started a journal. So I have a detailed register for what I did.

After graduation, I was worried that perhaps the governmental engineers wouldn't use my neural network because it was too cumbersome. To counteract this, [I made a website](https://modelodiquesanroque.web.app/) with a simple graphic interface that served my model and generated all the graphs needed. I had to translate all the pipelines and neural network code from Python to JavaScript and add the plots.

Then, I fell into a rabbit hole configuring my text editors (Vim and NeoVim) for more than a few days 😅. And right after that:

## My Indie Hacker journey began!

I decided to pursue indie hacking for a year, from **June 2020** to June 2021. After this period, I will reevaluate my position.

My first steps were:

- Double down on episodes of The Indie Hacker Podcast (2 per day) and other business-related content.
- Read and listened to books related to startups and business.
- Started to learn about how to write blogs and gain an audience.
- Created an Indie Hacker account.
- Published my first tweet

By the 30th of June (a few days in), I had my first viable project idea:

### Research Assistant

**A PDF reader app that uses AI to respond to questions about the file contents.** This way, instead of reading all the files searching for something, you can ask the AI to find it for you. **When is this useful?**:

- **If you need to find answers even when you don't know the exact keyword** (the AI knows that noble, king, and queen are related, for example).
- **If the keyword is heavily repeated** (When searching the definition of "carburetor" in a book about carburetors, the keyword "carburetor" won't do any good).

**The sheer awesomeness of the idea hooked me in**, and I committed my first error as an indie hacker (that I already knew I needed to avoid). I didn't talk to potential customers. I figured out that it was too awesome and that I didn't need further validation. So I started working.

# July

![](/media/Search-for-me-con-texto.png)

Spent most of the month building the MVP for [Search for me](https://searchforme.app) (former "Research Assistant"), following roughly these steps:

0. Wireframe
1. AI.
2. PDF reader.
3. Putt everything together to see if it works.
4. Solve all the critical problems (mostly GPU performance and pipeline)
5. Finish the first version of UI

**The 14th was a crucial day**. I had a meeting that enabled me to work as a civil engineer building a damn. It was a massive opportunity for a fresh out of the oven engineer. But it didn't align entirely with what I wanted to do with my life. It was hard, but after talking to my family, **I decided to double down on the indie hacker path**. I hope I did the right thing. Only time will tell.

By the 22nd of July, I had a functioning app (only on my machine), so I started researching the best alternatives to make or buy a landing page. A few options where:

- Make one from scratch.
- Modify a template.
- Use a service ( Carrd, ConvertKit, etc.).
- Create one with WordPress.

**On the 25th, I landed a freelance job, a mobile app**. I spent half of the next five days building the app for my client while still researching what to use as a landing page (and I bought the domain searchforme.app).

If you are asking: _"Why it took you so long to decide on a stack for your landing page?"_. Simple, because by then, I was too much an engineer and too little an entrepreneur, and I researched to oblivion all possible technologies and templates. Cause, you know... fun! (I know better now).

By the end of the month, **I decided to make my landing page with React + Material Design + ConvertKit**.

# August

I made the [landing page](https://searchforme.app) in a few days, then I added images and a video to make sure the value proposition was clear.

<figure>
	<img src="/media/ScreenShot_web_searchforme_V1.png" alt="">
	<figcaption>First version of my the Search For Me website.</figcaption>
</figure>

On the 10th, I wrote a post on Indie Hackers asking for a review of my landing page, and **I received the feedback that I expected but didn't want**. The landing page was ok. But there was a feature that would dramatically improve the value proposition: **Search of multiple PDFs simultaneously**.

I knew the importance of this feature, and I set it aside to cut down on time, following the lean MVP philosophy. But now that other people asked for it, I understood that the feature needed to be on the MVP, or I wasn't testing the real value proposition.

**I immediately started working on multiple PDF search.**

By nearly the end of the month, **I finished and compiled the new version of the MVP**. I published in Reddit asking for closed beta testers, a few responses, and half a dozen testers.

# September

On the **3rd was the official open beta launch of Search For Me**. I published on Twitter, Reddit, and Indie Hackers.

After only two days, I collected feedback about the ease of installation of the desktop app. It was too difficult to install because I didn't have a certificate of software authenticity. I didn't want to pay hundreds of USD for a software certificate, and I didn't want to go through all the hassle of adding the app to the Windows store.

I decided to **wait for a little while until I collected more feedback** from other people to know what to do (wrong feedback strategy, by the way).

While waiting, I went skating every morning, [made my personal website and blog](https://robertinomartinez.com/), wrote [my first article](https://robertinomartinez.com/posts/How-to-remember-anything-forever), and repaired my fridge.

<figure>

</figure>

I ran out of things to work on, and I couldn't postpone further the decision of what to do now with Search For Me. Based on the feedback, the app was difficult to install, and the AI was slow. This is what I needed to do to address the issues:

**Option one:**

- Purchase a certificate and distribute it independently ( a few hundred USD and no time). Or add the application to the Windows Store and App store ( 120USD and a few days ).
- Add a proper backend to the app, and perform further GPU optimizations.

**Option Two:**

- Rewrite the app as a website with a fast and robust backend. That way, I will be a platform-independent service.

The first option is more expensive but more convenient for users because they won't need to upload files. After all, the app is on their computer.

The second option is initially cheaper, and it doesn't need installing. But it is more cumbersome because you have to upload the files, and it will be more expensive to scale because of the need to store the files on the backend.

# October

I didn't know what to do with Search For Me, the response wasn't so good, and I already had like 10 more projects that I wanted to work on. So... I did what every beginner entrepreneur would do, and **I postponed the Search For Me refactoring and went to the next shiny thing (for now)**. I learned a lot from the project, and I will definitely apply that knowledge in future projects.

After the decision, I spent almost a week to decide between all the projects I wanted to do. It was hard; I had tons of interesting options in so many fields:

- Climate change.
- Language learning.
- Scientific research.
- Digital marketing.
- Education.
- Security and Privacy.
- Buildings.
- Etc.

I prioritized projects likely to make money in the shortest time (experience started to kick in) and ended up choosing a **niche course platform**. How did I decide this? More or less, these are my reasons:

- I don't have an audience, so I will create the firsts courses to start generating one.
- I have a unique value proposition tailored to a niche audience.
- I'm very familiar with the niche because I've been part of it for a long time.
- I like to learn and teach new things, and courses are an excellent opportunity to do both.
- I can execute using technologies that I already know.

I decided to [build the project in public](https://twitter.com/robertinomart/status/1316394237651542016?s=20) to increase awareness and to share my progress and problems.

On the 14th, I **started developing** the most minimum viable platform I could think of with a course about something I already knew.
At the time, I thought: _"This is the most minimal platform that I can make."_ And I was right! But (spoiler alert) I was wrong about which hypotheses to verify first.

I didn't need to verify that my niche audience would use a course platform, nor that they would pay for online courses. **I needed to confirm that my niche audience would pay for one with my particular format and that this format was preferred**.

So, in hindsight, just like **Emanuel Lasker** (one of the strongest chess players in history) said:

> _“When you see a good move, look for a better one”._

Well, **when you come up with a good MVP, think of a simpler one**.

A philosophy that I could have applied to my MVP and skip building the entire platform in favor to proceed straight to the course and verify the format hypotheses using a Concierge MVP. Oh well, next time I will do better.

# November and December

**I worked on the courses platform for almost exactly 1 month**. Obviously, at the same time, I was still reading, studying, listening to podcasts, doing client work, etc. Those were daily tasks and habits for the entire year ( I will try to add "regular exercise" to the list in 2021).

By **the 18th of November, I started working on the first course: _"Fundamentals of Web Development "_**. And then... I lost sight of the objective.

Two things happened:

- I moved to another apartment (meaning having to fix the old and new apartments, move before my former apartment contract expires, and organize everything in the new place).
- I got hooked on a note-taking/thinking system (The **Zettelkasten** method).

The moving part is understandable. But, to read, watch, and test every information I could find about the Zettelkastem method and the real efficiency behind it was a blunder. **I could have prioritized the course and have it finished before 2021**. Instead, I am estimating it will be available by the end of January beginning of February 2021.

# Final thoughts of the year 2020

Those were the highlights of the year, and **I'm happy** with my performance. I could have done more and better, but I think I made a significant step in the right direction, and I learned A LOT.

I'm also happy that I decided to try my luck as an indie hacker instead of working as a Civil Engineer or pursuing a graduate degree.

## Aims for the next year:

- Generate **1k of revenue** with my own projects (no freelancing).
- Start meal prepping to **improve diet**.
- **Exercise** at least two times a week.
- Limit studying to a few hours a day.
- Write at least **24 articles**.

To accomplish these aims, I'll adjust my systems and procedures accordingly and measure everything.

**Writing this review has made me grateful for so many things. 2020 was an unpredictable but incredible year. Thanks for reading!**
