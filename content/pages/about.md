## Civil engineer | Programmer | Entrepreneur

**When I was a kid**, I watched a documentary about the cosmic microwave background. I was so amazed by both the knowledge itself and the way that the scientist worked to find it that **I immediately fell in love with science and the scientific method**. With time, I develop the taste of not only wanting to know more but, to use that information to **solve real problems**. So I decided to become an engineer.

**In college, I started to code**. Making mobile apps for fun, soon I was caught by the endless possibilities of the programming world, and I started to learn everything I could:

- **Dart** and **Flutter** for mobile development.
- **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **TensorFlow** for data science and machine learning.
- **HTML**,**CSS**,**JS** and **React** for web development.
- **Electron** for Desktop development.

While studying engineering, programming, and science in general, **I became obsessed with understanding how the brain works, learns, and how we, as learners, can optimize our behavior**. As a result, it led me to have a better life, and I'm grateful for that.

**I graduated as a Civil engineer** in June 2020 from the National University of Technology in Argentina. I presented as a thesis the analysis and development of an **LSTM neural network** that predicts the reservoir level of the San Roque damn several months in advance. Said model is now being used by the government to manage more efficiently the water resource and energy generation of the damn.

**Now, I'm immersing in the entrepreneurial world**; Reading books, starting businesses, and looking to solve interesting problems and help people. You can see what I'm currently working on the **projects section**, or contact me through any of the links below the menu.
